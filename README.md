# RansomwarePython-PoC

Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) designed to block access to a computer system, its files, or its data until a sum of money (ransom) is paid. It often encrypts files or locks systems, making them inaccessible to the user. 
<br>This is a Ransomware Simulation in Python. It encrypts and decrypts the data (i.e. either a txt or png file) using a predefined key. If there is no key, encryption and decryption cannot be performed.

<b> Components:
<ol>
<li><b> Seperate Python Files for Encrypting and Decrpting the PNG and TXT Files. </b></li>
<li><b> Key File (Stores the key used for encrypting and decrypting the data) </b></li>
<li><b> TXT File (Sample Text File) </b></li>
<li><b> PythonLogo File (Sample PNG) </b></li>
</ol>
